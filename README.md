This repository is to show my journey of learning SQL from scratch. I learn SQL through the tutorial in mode.com where the structure is basic, intermediate, 
advanced, and SQL analytics training.

I am a slow learner and get confused easily. As I'm writing this on July 24th 2024, I'm stuck at learning JOINS because somehow I still couldn't really grasp the concept
comfortably. Also, I feel like I'm forgetting the things that I've been learning so far. I will try to document this as simple and structured as possible, so future me,
and in case any fellow turtle learners need help, I hope that you can find this helpful.
