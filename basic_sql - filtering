-- the % is a wildcard, it's like telling SQL to give you all that starts with Snoop (bcs you put the % in the back)
-- if you want to make sure that SQL gives you everything that contains Snoop, either starts with Snoop or not, use %Snoop%

/* filtering with IN operator */

-- this query will give you all columns whose value in the year_rank column is 1 or 2 or 3. I see it like filtering in
